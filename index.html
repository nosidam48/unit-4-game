  <h1>Crystal Collectors!</h1>
  <div>
  <p>Rules of the game:</p>
  <br>
  <p>At the start of the game you will be given a random number.</p>
  <br>
  <p>There are four crystals that will each be given a random number between 1 and 12. By clicking them you will add that value to your score</p>
  <br>
  <p>The value of each crystal will not be shown, you have to figure the values out as you click.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The object of the game is to have your score equal the random score exactly without going over.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you match the random number or go over it the game will restart with a new random number as well as new values for the crystals.</p>
